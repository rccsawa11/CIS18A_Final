Project's Title: Mobile Nail Services 

Project Description:
-What is it: This is a project I made for my CIS18A (Java Objects) class at Moreno Valley College. The project reflects all of the learning objectives of the class learned. 

-What this program does: This program was made to schedule appointments online for customers to book nail beauty services that offer at-home services. 

-What technologies I used: I did use an IDE- Micorsoft's Visual Studio Code 

-Some features I hope to implement in the future:In the future, to improve this program for efficiency, the program will offer multiple services per booking. Additionally, since this is a mobile service that is at the customers home, in future implementations gas prices will be evaluated and charges extra for services depending on the distances- 40 miles distance and under will be no charge, 41 and above will be charged gas price for mpg. In real life situations people are charged extra for at-home services the further they are. Also allowing clients to book multiple services at once and go back to be able to edit or cancel their appointment, as well as offering dates to book up to 2 months in advance. Additionally, perhaps having some visuals for clients to look at to make their decision more precise on how they want their services to be done 

The branches:
-I have included 2 addtional branches to the repository that includes the flow chart I made using Draw.io and the commit history to it,
as well as all of the documents I submitted on part of the rubric for this project
(that includes the visual to the flow chart and project reflections and the zip file). 

How to Install and Run the Project: 
-Taking the code from the repository's main branch and pasting into desired IDE, or downloading the zip file and running on complied Java files on notes and terminal. 

Include Credits: 
-Refreneced "sofiavaldes" README guide on how to write a good README: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-write-a-good-readme-file/.

-Unit 3-5 Notes from CIS18A with Dr. Nguyen (her notes based on the textbook).

-Used the 12 hour tutorial playlist "Java Full Course for Free" by "Bro Code" on youtube to help me make code to meet rubric requirements to implement into my program:

There was a video clip for most Java aspects and all of the learning objectives are also found in the playlist showing a step by step process.
